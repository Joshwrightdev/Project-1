# SPACE DASHBOARD

<!-- Description -->
For our project, we wanted to create a site that includes current data from both Mars and Earth, including data points like weather, climate, and photos. We used multiple APIs to present an interesting and dynamic array of data. We used photos from the NASA Mars rover, as well as data collected about climate.
